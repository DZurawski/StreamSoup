This is my team's undergraduate course project for CS 411 (Database Systems) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. StreamSoup is a website that allows users to track and search television shows offered by online streaming services. Users can rate the shows that they have watched and then view how everyone tends to rate shows using graphs that were created with "chart.js", an open source graph library. Information relating to TV show name, rating, genre, episodes, among other information was scraped from the streaming services' websites using Python scraping library, "BeautifulSoup". The site was originally hosted by cpanel with domain "streamsoup.web.engr.illinois.edu". The underlying database and the format of the SQL queries inside the PHP files use MySQL.

Unless specifically stated otherwise as a note, all files were written by Daniel Zurawski.
