In Regard to hulu.csv:

These are the TV shows provided by Hulu as of March 4, 2017.
Information comes from Hulu's website, https://www.hulu.com/start/content.

Commas separate in this order:
1.) Name of Show
2.) Genre of Show
3.) Number of Seasons
4.) Number of Episodes
5.) Hulu's Description of the Show

Unfortunately, Hulu did not have any information regarding actors who had roles in their shows. :(

Implementation details and how I scraped can be found in the hulu.py script.
Please take a look! If you catch any errors or possibilities for improvement, I am all ears.
