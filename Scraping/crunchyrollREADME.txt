In Regard to crunchyroll.csv:

These are the TV Shows provided by Crunchyroll as of March 5, 2017.
Information comes from Crunchyroll's website, "http://www.crunchyroll.com/videos/anime/alpha?group=all".

Commas separate in this order:
1.) Name of show
2.) Tags associated with the show
3.) Number of episodes/videos
4.) Year of airing
5.) Publisher
6.) Description of show

Warning: there are many blank entries for each show, since Crunchyroll did not provide complete information
for each show. However, most if not all shows have a description associated with its name.

Implementation details and how I scraped can be found in the crunchyroll.py script.
Please take a look! If you catch any errors or possibilities for improvement, I am all ears.
